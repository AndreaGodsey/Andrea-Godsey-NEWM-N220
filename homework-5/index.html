        are you willing to go, dear Player?

        You rent a cottage near the edge of a forest, and you are looking for
        your lost puppy: Snuggles. He ran off after chasing the evil bird that
        ever dared look at you in such distaste! Unfortunatley, defending your
        honor came with the price! He is lost, and now you must find him! But be
        warned, dear Player, for there may be creatures lurking in this small,
        chilly forest- waiting to find you-Good Luck, brave Player! You may
        choose first whether you rush to find your companion before dark. Or you
        may gather supplies, but risk rushing into the dark later. Whatever the
        case, you must find Snuggles-your small yet faithful companion! Make
        your choice now!
