        You rent a cottage near the edge of a forest, and you are looking for
        your lost puppy: Snuggles. He ran off after chasing the evil bird that
        ever dared look at you in such distaste! Unfortunatley, defending your
        honor came with the price! He is lost, and now you must find him! But be
        warned, dear Player, for there may be creatures lurking in this small,
        chilly forest- waiting to find you-Good Luck, brave Player! Find
        Snuggles-your small yet faithful companion!
